# 💻 Abhrajyoti Dhara's Portfolio

> *“Just a curious coder on a journey to turn caffeine into code.”*

Welcome to my **digital den** — a sleek, responsive, and minimalist portfolio website that reflects who I am as a developer. It's designed to showcase my journey, projects, tech stack, and how you can get in touch. Everything here screams **clean UI, interactive UX, and dev love.**

## 🌟 Features That Slap

- 🎨 **Dark Mode Toggle**  
  Your vibe, your theme. Light or dark, the choice is yours — and yes, it remembers thanks to `localStorage`.

- 📱 **Responsive Navigation**  
  Hamburger menu on mobile with smooth Bootstrap Icons? Yup, it's 100% mobile-friendly.

- 🚀 **Project Showcase**  
  Highlighting my recent builds with live demo links & GitHub repos. Go click-crazy.

- ✉️ **Contact Form with Google Apps Script**  
  Submissions go straight to a Google Sheet. No backend? No problem.

- 🔗 **Socials Integration**  
  GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram — one tap away. I'm everywhere devs hang out.
